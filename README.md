# PanyaBot
This is PanyaBot's Flask-based Programming Platform and has been a labour of love project for the past 2 years. 
This repo is home to the software that underpins all the functioning of our friendly robot, PanyaBot. The programming
 platform will allow for users to control PanyaBot through a block-based programming language as well as allowing for 
 general gameplay. Current plans include making sure that the Platform is fully developed to be as close to final/market
 ready. To run the instance, clone this repository to your Raspberry Pi, Intel Edison or any Unix-based
 OS (Untested) and execute run.py. This will check if all required dependancies are available and install them if not. You
 You will then be prompted to point your browser to a self-hosted URL where you will find the Programming Platform running.

The first instance of this web IDE can be found here -> https://github.com/Muuo/PanyaFace. Developed by Muuo Wambua, 
Elizabeth Ondula, Kimani Kinyajui, Brian Bosire, Wachira Ndaiga and Jessica Colaco of the iHub, the first iteration
 of PanyaBot was in every way of the word, a prototype, that went on to garner quite a bit of recognition. The team
  won a number of awards and honours through the Africa RObotics Network Design Challenge of 2014 
  (http://robotics-africa.org/2014-design-challenge).
Our latest iteration is intended to be as close to market ready, both in terms of hardware and software.
